# pokemon_file

This file is a modified copy of "Biuni"'s json script with a list of pok√©mon: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Biuni/PokemonGO-Pokedex/master/pokedex.json.
The file is used in the pokemon app that I'm working on. The app will not be published or anything like that. It is solely a project that I'm doing for fun in my sparetime.
